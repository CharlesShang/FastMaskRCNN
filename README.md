# Fast Mask RCNN
Mask RCNN in TensorFlow  
This repo attempts to reporduce this amazing work by Kaiming He.
[Mask RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).

## Known Problems
- [x] Allocate-Zero-Memory Error, solved by @santisy
- [ ] Allowing larger initial learning rate. 
- [ ] Chooseing proper initial weights.
## How-to
1. Download coco dataset, place it into `./data`, then run `python download_and_convert_data.py` to build tf-record. It takes a while.
2. Download pretrained resnet50 model, `wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/resnet_v1_50_2016_08_28.tar.gz`, unzip it, place it into `./data/pretrained_models/`
3. run `python test/resnet50_test.py` for training 
4. There are certainly some bugs, please report them back, and let's solve them together.
